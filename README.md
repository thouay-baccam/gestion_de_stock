## Features

- **Login Screen:** Lets you log into your SQL database without having to put your password in the code (which isn't safe, duh.)

- **Product Management:** Easily add, modify, and delete products, including specifying product name, description, price, quantity, and category.

- **Category Management:** Manage product categories by adding, modifying, and deleting them.

- **Filtering:** Filter products by category to quickly find specific items in your inventory.

- **Export to CSV:** Export your product data to a CSV file for external use or reporting.

## HOW TO USE

1. **To modify a product:** Make sure to click on the product on the list, then just input what you want to change and then press the modify product button.

2. **To delete a product:** Just click on a product and click the delete product button, easy peasy.
